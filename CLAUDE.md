Complete archive of deeppersonality.app — an AI-powered psychological assessment
platform. Includes Puppeteer/Cheerio scraper scripts, downloaded site assets,
and a comprehensive rebuild guide using Andrew Wilkinson's methodology.

## Project Structure

- `scripts/` — Node.js scraper (Puppeteer + Cheerio + Axios)

## Decision Documentation

This project maintains a decision log at `docs/decisions/`. At the start of
every session, read the most recent entry for context. At the end of every
session that involves code changes, create a new entry documenting the
decisions made. See docs/decisions/INDEX.md for the full history.
